#             may be specified via an rgb value in hex (ie: #ff173d)
#             or a valid color name (eg: red). For a list of available

#             Sun platforms see /usr/openwin/lib/rgb.txt.

sitecolor=#ff173d

# colorbarheight - the height of the bar across the top that shows
#                  the site color. The height is in pixels.
#

colorbarheight=3

# sitedescription - A string provides some help information for the site,
#                   such as "who is working on this site during a period".
#                   By default it is blank, if not, an icon will be shown
#                   on the statusbar. Clicking the icon will show/hide
#                   this string.
#

sitedescription=""

# Master site selected for this site
#
mastersite=

# siteicon    the name of an icon; must be the name of a file
#             in one of the cloverleaf bitmap directories.  If the
#             name begins with a "/" it is assumed to be an absolute
#             pathname to a file.

siteicon=genericSite.xbm

# statusbar - this is a string which defines the items you want
#             to have in the statusbar. The format is a series
#             of items separated by the vertical bar character.
#
# this keyword may appear in the rootInfo file as well. The
# siteInfo file will override it though. If you want to customize
# the statusbar once for all sites, do it in the rootInfo file; if
# you want to customize by site, do it here.
#
# This customization is not particularly fancy, but was thrown
# in to meet the needs of one of the Cloverleaf 3.1 beta sites.
# If you like this feature, be sure and let us know so we can
# expand it in future versions of the product.
#
# If there is a problem parsing your statusbar definition, errors
# will probably appear in a "big red box" or perhaps in a console
# window or in the window where you started the application.
#
# The following characters and keywords have special meaning:
#
#   $   the item is the name of an environment variable which
#       will be displayed in the statusbar. For example, the
#       value $HCISITE will cause the name of the site to be
#       displayed in the statusbar.
#
#   *   the ritem is the name of a bitmap file. The same
#       rules apply as for the siteicon keyword.
#
#   %   the item is the name of an internally known keyword.
#       The known keywords are:
#
#       %time       provides a real-time clock
#       %siteicon   the site icon; either a generic bitmap or
#                   one defined by the key "siteicon" in this file
#       %sitename   the name of the site. Same as $HCISITE.
#       %version    the current version of the product; this
#                   is similar to %rootname, but doesn't have
#                   "/hci/root" before the version.
#       %rootname   the name of the current root. Same as $HCIROOT
#
#  =   the rest of the item is the name of a unix command to be
#      executed once, at startup. The output of the command will
#      be displayed in the statusbar. One example would be
#      "=hostname", which would display the hostname of the machine
#      that the GUI is running on
#
# If the word has no special character at the start, the text appears
# as-is. You could use this to put the name of your hospital, for
# example.
#

statusbar=%sitename|%siteicon|%version

# here's an alternate version that some people prefer
#statusbar=%sitename|%rootname|=hostname
